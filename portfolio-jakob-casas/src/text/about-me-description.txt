I’m a web designer and developer based in Los Angeles.

Creativity has always been at the heart of who I am. From making music and performing in theater during high school, to dabbling in graphic design, creating has been a constant passion throughout my life.

Falling in love with web design and development felt like a natural extension of that creative journey. Growing up alongside the internet, I spent countless hours exploring websites where people expressed themselves, built communities, and shared their passions. Those experiences shaped me, and now I get to build those kinds of spaces for others.

Outside of work, you’ll usually find me creating video games for game jams, playing games, reading, writing, making music, or watching movies. I recently watched ***Whiplash*** — what a masterpiece! If you’ve seen it, let’s talk about it.
Feel free to reach out for project inquiries, collaborations, or just to say hi. I’m always open to good conversations.
